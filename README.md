# React Movie Browser

A Movie Browser made with ReactJS using the movieDB API.  
You can try it at https://reactmovieketels.web.app/

# What I learnt:

First project I made with ReactJS so I learnt ReactJS overall.  
Class/functional component.  
props/state.  
Fetching data from the movieDB API and display it.  
Routes, passing data through url parameters.  
Callbacks to get data from child to parent component.  
componentDidMount function to wait for the API request to finish before rendering the component.  
componentWillReceiveprops function to re-render the component when receiving a new props.  
Deploying to Heroku and Firebase.  
Using a Firebase database.  
Register/Log In system.  
Using environment variables for things like API key.
